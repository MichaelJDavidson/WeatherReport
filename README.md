# WeatherReport


C powered desktop application that gets weather data from openweathermap.org API using a locations Latitude and longitude. 
The Application creates a socket connection, receive and process the JSON response and display the processed data in Metric units.

--This will be Updated with ability to select different cities from a MySQL database and GTK+3 User Interface.

Currently the App is still being built component by component which helps me learn and understand and also way to show 
my understanding of Programming with C.
